**We are using the GitFlow Process for branch management!**
1. git branch -- Confirm you are on develop branch first, if not switch to it.
2. git fetch -- Grab latest metadata from develop to your local machine.
3. git pull -- Pull down the latest changes based on what you saw from fetch, from the remote develop branch.
4. git checkout -b branch_name -- Create your own feature branch that will be merged into develop once you are done.
5. Make some changes to files/folders.
6. git add . or git add file/folders -- Stage.
7. git commit -m 'your message'
8. git checkout develop -- Switch to develop for merging.
9. git merge feature_branch_name -- Merge your feature branch into develop.
